    "# Miniproject 3: Landing on the Moon\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, reinforcement learning has operated on \"tabular\" state spaces, e.g. \"State 1\", \"State 2\", \"State 3\" etc. However, many important and interesting reinforcement learning problems (like moving robot arms or playing Atari games) are based on either continuous or very high-dimensional state spaces (like robot joint angles or pixels). Deep neural networks constitute one method for learning a value function or policy from continuous and high-dimensional observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this miniproject, you will teach an agent to play the Lunar Lander game from OpenAI Gym. The agent needs to learn how to land a lunar module safely on the surface of the moon (at coordinate [0,0]). The state space is 8-dimensional and (mostly) continuous, consisting of the X and Y coordinates of the lander, the X and Y velocity, the angle of the lander, the angular velocity, and two booleans indicating whether the left and right leg of the lander have landed on the moon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent gets a reward of +100 for landing safely and -100 for crashing. In addition, it receives \"shaping\" rewards at every step. It receives positive rewards for moving closer to [0,0], decreasing in velocity, shifting to an upright angle and touching the lander legs on the moon. It receives negative rewards for moving away from the landing site, increasing in velocity, turning sideways, taking the lander legs off the moon and for using fuel (firing the thrusters). The largest reward it can achieve on a step is about +-100. The best score an agent can achieve in an episode is about +250; \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two versions of the task: one with discrete controls and one with continuous controls. In the discrete version, the agent can take one of four actions at each time step: [do nothing, fire engines left, fire engines right, fire engines down]. In the continuous version, the agent sets two continuous actions at each time step: the amount of engine thrust and the direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Policy Gradient approaches to learn the task. In the previous miniprojects, the network generates a probability distribution over the outputs, and is trained to maximize the probability of a specific target output given an observation. In Policy Gradient methods, the network generates a probability distribution over actions, and is trained to maximize expected future rewards given an observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- If using docker, download the latest version of the image. Otherwise: You should have a running installation of [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/), [keras](https://keras.io/), [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/docs/) and Box2D.\n",
    "- You should know the concepts of \"policy\", \"policy gradient\", \"REINFORCE\" and \"REINFORCE with baseline\". If you want to start and haven't seen this yet in class, read Sutton & Barto (2018) Chapter 13 (13.1-13.4 and 13.7).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will learn how to implement a policy gradient neural network using the REINFORCE algorithm.\n",
    "- You will learn how to implement baselines, including a learned value network.\n",
    "- You will learn how to adapt your network for both discrete and continuous control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes \n",
    "- Reinforcement learning is noisy! Normally one should average over multiple random seeds with the same parameters to really see the impact of a change to the model, but we won't do this due to time constraints. However, you should be able to see learning over time with every approach. If you don't see any improvement, or very unstable learning, double-check your model and try adjusting the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may sometimes see \"AssertionError: IsLocked() = False\" after restarting your code. To fix this, reinitialize the environments by running the Gym Setup code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will not be marked on the episode movies. If your notebook file is large before uploading, delete them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The miniproject is marked out of 15, with a further mark breakdown in each question:\n",
    "- Exercise 1: 5 points\n",
    "- Exercise 2: 2 points\n",
    "- Exercise 3: 3 points\n",
    "- Exercise 4: 5 points\n",
    "\n",
    "We may perform random tests of your code but will not rerun the whole notebook."

    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the REINFORCE Policy Gradient algorithm using a deep neural network as a function approximator.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement the \"observe\" method of the RLAgent above.\n",
    "2. Implement the \"_build_network\" method. Your network should take the 8-dimensional state space as input and output a softmax distribution over the 4 discrete actions. It should have 2-3 hidden layers with about 10-20 units each and ReLU activations. Use the REINFORCE loss function. HINT: Keras has a built-in \"categorical cross-entropy\" loss, and a \"sample_weight\" argument in fit/train_on_batch. Consider how these could be used together.\n",
    "3. Implement the \"decide\", \"train\" and \"_get_returns\" methods using the inputs and outputs of your network. In \"_get_returns\", implement a baseline based on a moving average of the returns; it should only be in effect when the agent is constructed with the \"use_baseline\" keyword. In \"train\", use train_on_batch to form a minibatch from all the experiences in an episode. \n",
    "4. Try a few learning rates and pick the best one (the default for Adam is a good place to start). Run the functions below and include the resulting plots, with and without the baseline, for your chosen learning rate. Plot the last movie from the baseline results. \n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING: Running any experiments with the same names (first argument in run_experiment) will cause your results to be overwritten. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Mark breakdown: 5 points total**\n",
    "- 3 points for implementing and plotting basic REINFORCE with reasonable performance (i.e. a positive score).\n",
    "- 2 points for implementing and plotting the simple baseline with reasonable performance."

    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a second neural network to your model that learns an observations-dependent adaptive baseline and subtracts it from your discounted returns, to reduce variance in learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modify the \"_build_network\" function of RLAgent to create a second \"value network\" when \"adaptive\" is passed for the baseline argument. The value network should have the same or similar structure as the policy network, without the softmax at the output.\n",
    "2. Subtract the simple baseline from the discounted returns as you did above to get the adjusted returns R - b.\n",
    "3. In addition to training your policy network, train the value network on the Mean-Squared Error compared to the adjusted returns.\n",
    "4. Train your policy network on R - b - b(s), i.e. the adjusted returns minus the adaptive baseline (the output of the value network).\n",
    "5. Try a few learning rates and plot all your best results together (without baseline, with simple baseline, with adaptive baseline). You may or may not be able to improve on the simple baseline! Return the trained model to use it in the next exercise.\n",
    "6. (Optional, no influence on grade) Try giving the policy and value networks different learning rates to see if you can improve performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "TECHNICAL NOTE: Some textbooks may refer to this approach as \"Actor-Critic\", where the policy network is the \"Actor\" and the value network is the \"Critic\". Sutton and Barto (2018) suggest that Actor-Critic only applies when the discounted returns are bootstrapped from the value network output, as you saw in class. This can introduce instability in learning that needs to be addressed with more advanced techniques, so we won't use it for this miniproject. You can read more about state-of-the-art Actor-Critic approaches here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf\n",

    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "One disadvantage of Q-learning-type approaches is that they require that the agent take discrete actions (\"left\", \"right\", \"up\", \"down\" etc.). In policy gradient, the agent learns a distribution over actions for each observation. That distribution can be either discrete (as we saw above) or continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will switch to continous actions. The agent has a 2D action at each time step: a value in [-1,1] to control the amount of thrust, and a value in [-1,1] to control the left/right direction of the thrust. Since the output is bounded, we will model it with a Beta distribution: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Beta distribution is defined by 2 parameters: alpha and beta. The network should output both for each action. We will ensure that alpha >= 1 and beta >= 1, which keeps the distribution unimodel and well-behaved. The agent then samples from a distribution defined by [alpha,beta] for each action and transforms the [0,1] output to [-1,1] to act.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify your model in the following ways when it detects that self.continuous is True:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your policy network should have 4 outputs: one alpha and one beta for each action. Use a softplus output, which ensures the output is >=0. Then use the AddValue function defined above to add 1 to each unit in the output layer.\n",
    "2. Create a custom Keras loss function to calculate the log probability of the episode actions taken under the policy. HINT: look at what you can do with the tensorflow.contrib.distributions.Beta module imported above.\n",
    "3. Adjust the other methods appropriately for the continuous case (use np.random.beta to make a decision).\n",
    "4. Rerun the agent for the continuous case with several different learning rates and either the simple or adaptive baseline, and plot an episode.\n",
    "5. Finally, adapt your function from the Exercise 3 to plot the expected thrust and thurst direction across the XY space for your best model. Use several values of the other state variables, including [0,0,0,0,0,0]. Use the expectation of the Beta distribution. There should be 2 plots for each state variable condition: one for thrust and one for thrust direction. \n",
